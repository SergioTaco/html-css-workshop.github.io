# Code Along

<br>
Your Portfolio Page consists of 3 different pages. First and the main page is Home Page. Second one is About Page and third one is Contact Page. You can navigate between pages.

<br> <br>

1. Your portfolio should have a home page. Home page should have a header section with an id of "header". In this header section there will be a division with an id of "container". This container will have two other divisions. First division will have an "h1" element that contains text. Second division will have a navigation bar.

```
<div id="header">
        <div class="container">
            <div id="branding">
                <h1>Sergio <span id="spanColor">Taco </span> </h1>
            </div>
            <div id="nav">
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="index.html" target="_blank">HOME</a></li>
                    <li><a href="about.html" target="_blank">ABOUT</a></li>
                    <li><a href="contact.html" target="_blank">CONTACT</a></li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
```

<br>
2.  Home page should have a main section with an id of "main". Main section will have a division with an id of "container". This container will have an "h1" and "p" elements that contain text.

```
<div id="main">
    <div class="container">
        <h1>
            I'm a Web Designer
        </h1>
        <p>
            Lorem, ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Incidunt quos rerum consectetur?
        </p>

     </div>
</div>
```

<br>
3.  Your about page should have an about section with an id of "about. About section will have an "h2" and "p" elements that contain text.

```
<div id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Sergio Taco! <br> I'm a Freelance Web Designer focused on creating clean, responsive web designs!
        </p>
</div>
```

<br>
4.  Your contact page should have an contact section with an id of "contact. Contact section will have an "h2" and two "p" elements that contain text.

```
